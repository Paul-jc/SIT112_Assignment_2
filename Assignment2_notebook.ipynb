    "Thus far in this assignment, we have collected tweets for each keyword and analysed them seperately. We have constructed the term-by-document matrix for each collection of tweets seperately. A fundemantal and common task in data science, analytics, machine learning, science and engineering is **clustering**. This is also known as unsupervised learning or exploratory data analysis as we have learned in our classes.\n",

To do so, we need to compute the **distance** between **any** two pair of tweets. This requires us to compute a **joint** term-by-document matrix for all tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that we **cannot** use the individual term-by-document matrices computed earlier (e.g.,***k1_termdoc, k2_termdoc, k3_termdoc***) for this task is because they have different dictionary sizes. Hence, tweets collected for different keywords have been represented by vectors of different dimension. \n",
